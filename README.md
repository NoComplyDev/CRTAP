# **Critical Role TTRPG Archive Project (CRTAP)**

>Work in progress. Currently considering hosting options (if I decide to make this publicly available at all). Should ideally be easy to add new episodes and have them pushed automatically, however torrent may be the only feasible solution in terms of bandwidth (currently clocking in at 1.36TB)

## Core Archival Purposes


- The primary purpose of this archive is to preserve the original viewer experience via allowing everything to be easily viewed as originally broadcast.

- The secondary purpose of this archive is to provide a solution better than Beacon. Beacon is missing large amounts of content; some for legal/ethical reasons and some is simply omitted. It is also horrible to navigate, often serves far worse quality media than other (freely available) sources and has consistently demonstrated very poor server stability, capacity and speed. **I strongly endorse supporting Critical Role financially and encourage everybody reading this to do so,** but purely from a UX perspective Beacon is not worth the money in the state it is currently in.

- The tertiary purpose of this archive is to allow for easy viewing of Critical Role content outside of YouTube and Twitch. YouTube sucks and sells your data. Twitch also sucks and sells your data. If you’re concerned about this project causing Critical Role to lose out on ad revenue, subscribe to Beacon before you use it. Critical Role will make far more money from a single subscription than a lifetime of clicks from a single user. 

- **Piracy is NOT the purpose of this archive.** I do not endorse the viewing of Beacon-exclusive content without having an active subscription. Any such media is included ONLY because the project would be worthless as an archive without it. 

- This is NOT an exhaustive archive of everything ever released under the Critical Role umbrella, nor will it ever be. It is primarily focused on tabletop gameplay/content directly related to tabletop gameplay, taking primary guidance on what to include from the episode list available here: https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes. See the rest of this readme for more information.

### Notes Regarding Included Media

Please refer to the following before asking any questions about whether or not something is included (or will be included in the future):

- This archive contains original Critical Role content only. Critical Role umbrella series such as Midst are not included and likely never will be.

- Content largely unrelated to TTRPGs such as Weird Kids, All Work No Play, More-Sided Dive and Narrative Telephone is not included and likely never will be. 

- Cast interviews such as Between the Sheets / Livestream Q&As are not & will likely not ever be included unless specifically listed [here](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes).

- Abridged/Recap content is not included and likely never will be.

- Promo videos, trailers and similar are not included and likely never will be. 

- The ‘Specials’ list at [List of episodes | Critical Role Wiki | Fandom](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes) is very poorly managed and extremely inconsistent. Therefore I have made some additions and adjusted the numbering convention. Please see [below](#specials) for more information.

## Extraction Info


- Quality: Highest publicly available (all sources).

- Software Used: Pinchflat v2025.5.5 / v2025.6.6 (YouTube), VDH 10.0.145.2 (everything else)
- Error Scans: ffmpeg 7.1.1 - Logged with custom script (output: Log.txt in each subfolder containing video). 

- Subtitles: Only fully-transcribed subtitles are included. No auto-generated subtitles are included. YouTube Premuxed. Beacon manually muxed and retimed where necessary (Subler 1.9.1, SubtitleTools). Some subtitles that were thought lost have been salvaged from [Filmot](http://filmot.com) (English only). Filmot is not without flaws; any bugs are discussed [below](#further-notes).

## Metadata & Naming


- Tagging: MP3Tag 1.9.6, Yate 8.3.4

- Airdates and runtimes checked vs https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes.

- Used original Twitch/YouTube Livestream airdates where applicable, NOT upload dates. Where platforms differ, whichever is earliest is preferred. 

- Basic Plex file-naming / folder structure conventions are used for convenience. 

- Numbering conventions generally follow https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes, however some changes have been made. This is to account for compatibility, mistakes and any obvious omissions. 

- Naming conventions follow [List of episodes | Critical Role Wiki | Fandom](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes) with the exception of three Specials that have since been renamed on YouTube/Beacon to what I consider more appropriate titles. See the Specials section under ‘Further Notes’ below for more information.

## Manual Fixed & Edits


- S01E031, S01E033 and S01E035 stitched using ffmpeg. The GeekAndSundry segmented uploads for these episodes are not accurate to broadcast and cause metadata issues when importing to media servers. 

- All content sourced from u/BetterThatTofu’s archive re-encoded from the original WebM (VP9) to MP4 h.264 for compatibility purposes (Handbrake 1.8.2 - h.264 VideoToolBox - VFR - CQ 63 - AAC 256).

- Audio for The Re-Slayer’s Take sourced from Beacon. Video created manually using modified official art. HEVC encoded for file size purposes (Handbrake 1.8.2 - h.265 VideoToolBox - VFR - CQ 80 - AAC 160).
- The ‘Welcome to The Re-Slayer’s Take’ repeated intro has been removed from all episodes of The Re-Slayer’s Take. Nobody needs to hear the same 60-second game format introduction 30 times. 

- S00E048 ‘Feast of Legends’ re-encoded from the original MP4 Base Media to MP4 h.264 for file size purposes (Handbrake 1.8.2 - h.264 VideoToolBox - VFR - CQ 63 - AAC Passthrough). The episode clocked in at an impressive 21.86GB prior to processing.

## Further Notes


### General

- Regarding UnDeadwood, Talks Machina and Honey Heist 1 & 2: I am aware of Brian W. Foster’s alleged behaviour towards Ashley Johnson and multiple other CR employees. I fully support the decision taken by Critical Role to remove all content featuring him. The inclusion of these episodes is in no way an endorsement of the character of Brian W. Foster. Please refer to the [primary archival purpose](#core-archival-purposes) stated at the top of this document for more information. The same logic also applies to the Feast of Legends special, in relation to that particular sponsorship controversy. 

- YouTube was selected as the source for all freely available episodes de to a lot of ad break content being well worth archiving / Beacon video & audio quality often being significantly worse.

- With the exception of The Re-Slayer’s Take (where video fidelity is not an issue), any content that needed re-encoded was encoded using h.264 rather than h.265/HEVC to A. Keep the main video format consistent and B. Compromise video quality as little as possible. 

- Regarding the re-encoding process used on u/BetterThanTofu’s archive: h.264 VTB CQ 63 was as lossless as I could go without adding (literally) months of processing time to my GPU. Visually the output is practically indistinguishable from the source. File sizes are slightly reduced on average. 

- The following paragraph only applies to any private tracker freaks out there: Some Log.txt files will show manual edits. Try not to immediately piss yourself at the thought. I updated the (TextEdit) with new log info after fixing/truncating errors, rather than wasting hours of my life reprocessing an entire batch. If you don’t like this, please feel free to do it again yourself.

- Regarding the Decode Integrity errors on Critical Role episodes S00E015 and S01E067; Non-monotonic DTS is a warning rather than an actual problem. All modern playback software will be able to handle it without issue. If you really want to fix these two episodes yourself, re-encode, but it really isn’t necessary. 

- Twitch chats are not archived (and will never be) because I’m not insane.
<br/>

### Specials

- Episode numbering diverges from https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes. The reason for this is that, for whatever reason, the top contributors to the Fandom aren’t willing to retroactively implement consistent rules regarding what should and should not be added, despite being well aware of such issues (see a relevant discussion between said top contributors [here](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:CelebriD&D_with_Joe_Manganiello)). As a result, as of the time of writing, two episodes of debatable and obvious canonical importance respectively have simply been left omitted from the list. This is despite numerous convention recordings that are wildly less important still being added and regularly updated. I’ve included the omitted episodes in the archive and therefore the numbering is different. 

- S00E001, S00E028 and S00E029 use the currently listed episode title rather than the title listed on the Wiki because, in these specific cases, the new titles are much more appropriate. Example: the Wiki lists S00E029 as ‘Critical Role One-Shot: Kobolds, Catacombs and Dragons (Oh My!)’. The currently listed title for that episode on both YouTube and Beacon is ‘Hearthstone One-Shot’. Much easier to both find at a glance and parse for the subject matter. 

- When adding to Plex: If not using local metadata, Plex will mismatch most episodes due to an older Specials database existing. 

- S00E004 ‘November 2015 Critmas’ was originally intended for broadcast as part of Critical Role S01E031 ‘Gunpowder Plot’ - it was split and uploaded as a special by Geek and Sundry due to livestream technical difficulties at broadcast. 

- S00E005 ‘December 2015 Critmas’ was originally broadcast as part for Critical Role S01E035 ‘Denouement’ - it was split and uploaded as a separate special by Geek and Sundry due to technical issues uploading to YouTube. 

- Subtitles were never transcribed for the following episodes and are therefore not included:
  
  - S00E004 ‘November 2015 Critmas’
    
  - S00E005 ‘December 2015 Critmas’
    
  - S00E013 ‘Critical Role’s ‘The Dating Game’ Panel SDCC 2016’
    
  - S00E014 ‘Critical Role Answers Your Questions at SDCC!’
    
  - S00E019 ‘Talks Machina - Pants Optional Critmas’
    
  - S00E021 ‘Talks Machina Live With Brian W. Foster and Critical Role! (SDCC 2017)’
    
  - S00E033 ‘Critmas!’
    
  - S00E034 ‘Talks Machina Fireside Special’
    
  - S00E035 ‘Fireside Chat & NPC Build with Matthew Mercer’
    
  - S00E041 ‘Fireside Chat with Sam Riegel’
    
  - S00E049 ‘Feast of Legends’
    
  - S00E051 ‘End of 2019 Fireside Chat’
    
  - S00E054 ‘Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount Q&A and Fireside Chat with Matthew Mercer’
    
  - S00E102 ‘Thank Goodness it’s Thursday’

    
- The following subtitles were salvaged from [Filmot](https://filmot.com) and muxed manually:
  
  - S00E022 ‘Critical Role: Bar Room Blitz’
    
  - S00E028 ‘Trinket’s Honey Heist’
    
  - S00E032 ‘Talks Machina: Campaign Wrap Up’
    
  - S00E036 ‘Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo’
    
  - S00E039 ‘Critical Role and the Club of Misfits’
    
- The subtitles for S00E039 ‘Critical Role and the Club of Misfits’ are bugged - for some reason Filmot archived SRTs sometimes tend to repeat every line. This could be fixed manually, but I don’t have the time.
<br/>

### Candela Obscura

- S05E01 ‘Candela Obscura Live - The Circle of the Silver Screen’ is considered a single episode season as stated on https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes.

- Season 5 Poster is custom.

- Candela Obscura Specials (S00) includes each ‘Creating Characters for Candela Obscura’ episode (these are not listed on [List of episodes | Critical Role Wiki | Fandom](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes) despite many, many other Session Zero-style episodes being listed for other mini-campaigns).
<br/>

### CR Cooldown

- Episodes begin at S03E083, corresponding to Critical Role S03E083. This seemed neater than creating a single season. No episodes of CR Cooldown were released prior to this.

- CR Cooldown Specials (S00) consists of all episodes outside of the main campaigns, in release order. 

- Subtitles were never transcribed for the following episodes and are therefore not included:
  
  - S00E002 ‘Candela Obscura Cooldown - The Circle of the Silver Screen’
<br/>

### Talks Machina

- Talks Machina was cancelled in 2021 and removed from all platforms in July of 2023.

- Poster is custom, thumbnail used for all episodes is the final official art created for the show.

- Some episodes listed on [List of episodes | Critical Role Wiki | Fandom](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_episodes) are missing from u/BetterThanTofu’s archive. These were instead ripped from InternetArchive and are all (unfortunately) of a significantly worse quality. 

- Yes, I know transcoding media to 256kbps is useless if the source is a lower bitrate. In certain circumstances however, it can be marginally less bad than transcoding to the same bitrate; hence why I did it here a few times when necessary (see ‘Manual Fixes & Edits’). 

- Subtitles were never transcribed for any episode of Talks Machina and are therefore not included. Auto-generated subtitles are available at [Filmot](https://filmot.com) if you have the original YouTube links.
<br/>

### The Re-Slayer's Take

- I decided to include The Re-Slayer’s Take in video format for compatibility and ease of playlist creation. Beacon was chosen as the audio source due to no ads being present. Video and thumbnails were created manually. 

- The ‘Welcome to The Re-Slayer’s Take’ repeated intro has been removed from all episodes.

- The Re-Slayer's Take Specials (S00) consists of any ‘Bonus Take’ episodes. 

- Subtitles were never transcribed for any episode of The Re-Slayer’s Take and are therefore not included. You can however find transcriptions for each episode on Beacon (subscribers only).
<br/>

### UnDeadwood

- Poster is custom.

- Subtitles for all episodes of UnDeadwood were salvaged from [Filmot](https://filmot.com) and muxed manually. 

- Subtitles for S00E01, S00E02 and S00E04 are bugged - for some reason Filmot archived SRTs sometimes tend to repeat every line. This could be fixed manually, but I don’t have the time.
